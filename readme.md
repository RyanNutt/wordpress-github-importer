## GitHub Importer WordPress Plugin

Loads content from GitHub into WordPress posts and pages.

This is very much a work in progress and not even close to a production ready plugin. As I'm writing this the plugin does almost nothing, but I wanted to go ahead and get the repo setup so I could start pushing updates.
